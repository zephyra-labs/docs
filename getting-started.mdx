## Zephyra Introduction

Welcome to **Zephyra** — a modular backend platform built for modern enterprise and decentralized systems.  
This guide will walk you through installing dependencies, configuring your environment, and running the project locally.

---

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A **Firebase project** with:
  - Firestore Database
  - Firebase Authentication
  - Service Account credentials (Admin SDK)

---

## Quick Setup

<Steps>

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zephyra-labs/backend.git
cd backend
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following content:

```bash
FIREBASE_ADMIN_JSON=./serviceAccountKey.json
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

Place your Firebase **Admin SDK JSON** credentials in the project root under `serviceAccountKey.json`.

### Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

By default, Zephyra runs on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

</Steps>

---

## Authentication Setup

Zephyra uses **Firebase Authentication**.
You can log in with a test account or generate a token manually using the Firebase Admin SDK.

```bash
firebase auth:sign-in-with-email user@example.com
```

Once you have a valid Bearer token, you can call any authenticated API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Available Services

| Service      | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Auth**     | Handle registration, login, and verification of users. |
| **User**     | Manage user profiles, roles, and permissions.          |
| **KYC**      | Perform and track Know Your Customer verifications.    |
| **Contract** | Manage contract metadata and associated logs.          |
| **Activity** | Record internal and external user activities.          |

You can explore each service in the **API Reference** section.

---

## Testing

Zephyra includes full **Jest** test coverage for DTOs, models, and services.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

You’ll see output similar to:

```
 PASS  src/models/__tests__/userModel.test.ts
 PASS  src/dtos/__tests__/kycDTO.test.ts
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
```

---

## Build and Production

To build and run Zephyra in production mode:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

This will compile TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` folder and start the server using compiled code.
