## Environment Setup

This guide explains how to configure your local environment to run Zephyra successfully.

---

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Node.js 22+ installed
- pnpm package manager installed
- Firebase CLI installed
- Access to the Firebase project and Admin SDK JSON

---

## Set up Environment Variables

<Steps>

### Create a `.env` file

In the root folder of your Zephyra backend project, create a file named `.env`:

```bash
touch .env
```

### Add required variables

Add the following content:

```bash
# Path to Firebase Admin SDK JSON
FIREBASE_ADMIN_JSON=./serviceAccountKey.json

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Backend server port
PORT=5000

# Optional: enable debug logging
DEBUG=true
```

### Place Firebase Admin SDK

Make sure your Firebase **Admin SDK JSON** is in the project root as:

```
serviceAccountKey.json
```

### Verify environment variables

You can quickly check that Node reads the variables:

```bash
node -e "console.log(process.env.FIREBASE_ADMIN_JSON)"
```

It should print the path to your JSON file.

</Steps>

---

## Notes

* **Do not commit `.env` or `serviceAccountKey.json`** to Git — they contain sensitive credentials.
* For **production**, you can use environment variables set on the hosting platform (Firebase Hosting, Vercel, etc.).
* You can create multiple `.env` files for different environments (`.env.development`, `.env.production`) and load them accordingly.
